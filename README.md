The Firework Engine
===================

A game engine for console based games written in .NET

Current Todo list:
* Have some actual documentation
* Do a proper example
* Split the classes into several namespaces (e.g. all UI elements into one namespace)
* Find a solution for enabling elements to be borderless
* Infer the size of an UIScene
